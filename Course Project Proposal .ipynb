    "Why: Visual tools are crucial for spotting trends,patterns, and outliers in the data, and for illistruating ootential relationships visually before formal testing. \n",

    "Why: It offers a statistical range that likely contains the true mean,adding precision to our estimates and supporting subsequent hypothesis testing.\n",
